## Why This Matters

We built a system that:
- **Remembers everything** (persistent memory)
- **Proves what it did** (cryptographic provenance)
- **Learns continuously** (meta-learning)
- **Runs locally** (no cloud, no API costs)
- **Self-improves** (Entropy Loop)

This is the foundation for truly autonomous AI systems that grow smarter over time without human intervention.
