# Changelog

All notable changes to the "Champion Council" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-02-13
- **Fixed**: Diagnostics compact view now dynamically extracts ALL fields from tool responses instead of a hardcoded subset that missed most data.
- **Fixed**: Nested tool response objects (weights, params, config, adapter shapes) are flattened and displayed in the KV grid.
- **Improved**: Small arrays (e.g. tensor shapes) now show actual values instead of "[N items]".
- **Improved**: Source/fallback provenance shown in diagnostic header metadata.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-02-13
- **Fixed**: Diagnostics tab now routes every diagnostics action through robust fallback orchestration (tool + fallback tools + MCP resources).
- **Fixed**: Dead-zone outputs in diagnostics (null/unknown/error-only states) are now normalized and enriched with available runtime data.
- **Improved**: Diagnostics output UI now shows compact health/fallback/probe summaries with expandable resolved payload and probe trace sections.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-02-13
- **Fixed**: Memory tab Export now opens a format picker instead of routing to unrelated UI behavior.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-13
- **Fixed**: Memory tab now refreshes FelixBag catalog when external bag mutations occur (`bag_put`, `bag_induct`, `bag_forget`, `pocket`, `load_bag`).
- **Fixed**: Memory stats/count and item list now update dynamically after external inductions without manual catalog click.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-13
